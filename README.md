#Clicky Game
This is a react based web application that allows you to guess a random comedian. Once you select comedian, the position of all the comedians will randomly change. The objective of the game is to click on all 12 comedians only once without selecting the same comedian!

##Motivation
The goal was to showcase my skills in react by building a basic react app that has multiple components and props.

##Technologies Used
